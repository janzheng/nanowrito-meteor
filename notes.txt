Things in the horizon / Potential ideas
---


--- imminent

- Settings
   - sessions
      - on / off
      - turn on/off 'session grid' in dashboard - can be annoying for ppl w/o Flash who need to copy. Can't select all and copy
   - share novel
      - private, shared
   - share url 
   - note: shared novels update in real time

- Word Goal
- add nanowrito mode (30 days, 50k words)
   - add microwrito mode (7 days, 10k words)
   - add dreamwrito mode (5 minute countdown, every day)
   - camp nano feature in the future

- edit session
   - add lock date
   - exclude a section from the flow + count /"deactivate" (nah not yet)
   - delete session (not undoable)
   - edit word count real time when editing (nah - updates when users save. editing isn't for rewriting sections)


WORD WAR!!


- way beyond the horizon if people want:
   - read people's essays / essay browser / best of / lists / upcoming
   - publish / sharing / public link / social sharing links
   - live writing / voyeurism / sharing
   - novel tagging 



--- near future
- clean up SCSS 
- clean up code structure
   refactor notes
   - user- is used for options in css and js, but should switch to option- to be clearer
   - use bem-like notation / struct


- word war!
- able to CRUD/edit and move sessions around?

- write or die features
   - auto erase

- word puppet mode
   - every word your write (spaces) add to the text
   - meat puppet mode: every letter gets added to text
   - novel list - peek at the first sentence?

- novel browser



--- way future
- encryption using oauth-encryption - still work in progress / no access to package. on hold

- ability to change twitter accounts in the future?!
- voting
- comments + moderation (use ext. service?)
- chapters and section tags / tagging
- notes
- download - need to wait for Meteor's CollectionFS package to become more stable




--- done!

- Duplicate all the functionality from Nanowrito 1
- add accounts: twitter, fb login, or keep it anonymous (no save) --- only twitter for now
- add create new story / track stories / CRUD stories
- "continuing {{novel title}}" or "write new novel " for write app
- instead of writing / continuing the entire novel, create a new "session?" and only write to that session?
- logged out state to logged in state save transition
- make mobile friendly - esp. iPad. Local / offline friendly as well would be nice. (no offline mode available for now)
- style the errors (a little buggy- duplicate errors showing. whatever)
- add legal notes. Saving, storing, security, etc.
- Main Settings
   - username
   - font size
   - Word Counter
      - Off
      - Writing Mode 
      - Writing & Zen Mode

- clicking Back in a novel should take you back to the novel you just wrote

- responsive styles
- new novel page- wide page, the styles break (titles need to have own rows)


--- to consider / shelved

- combine sessions? doesn't seem necessary
- add a blog area (replaced with a twitter - could maybe input from the API?)
